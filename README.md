Project for EZPCOpen SDK in C#, based on the original in C++, for version v5.1.13_build20230104.

I'm sharing this because there is no official C# version of the SDK originally for c++, in order to help!

You need to access the ezvizlife website and download the SDK, as well as having access data to the platform.

Basic functions, live viewing and decrypting images, however all other functions are already included in the class, just implement them.

To launch the SDK:
_SDK.Start("AuthAddr url", "Platform url", "AppId", "token")

Starts live playback:
startRealPlay()

Help, ideas and suggestions are welcome!
